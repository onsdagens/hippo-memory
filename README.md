# Hippo Memory

This wraps an inferred BRAM-based memory mostly ripped from [Atalanta](https://github.com/soc-hub-fi/atalanta) in a Bender package.

## Repo structure

The base Bender package is contained in the root of this repo.

Under `./fpga/` we include a separate Bender package intended as a minimal synthesizeable example of using the memory.
If you're unsure of how to procede, this is probably a good start.
